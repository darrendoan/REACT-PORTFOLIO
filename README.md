# REACT-PORTFOLIO

## Description
This is a personal portfolio webpage showcasing my bio, recent works, and contact information. Built using React and material UI, it provides a seamless, single-page experience for visitors to learn more about me and my skills.

Features:
 - Bio: A brief introduction about myself.
 - Projects: Showcase of recent works/projects.
 - Skills: Highlighting my skillset.
 - Contact Form: Allows visitors to reach out for potential collaborations or inquiries.
   
Technologies Used:
 - React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
 - Material-UI: React components that implement Google's Material Design.
   
Learning Experience:
By building this project, I gained valuable experience in React development, including:
 - Creating components
 - Managing state
 - Handling user interactions

I also learned how to structure a single-page application and incorporate different sections and features. Additionally, I gained knowledge about styling and layout using both plain css and Material UI.

### User Story
```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

```

### Acceptance Criteria
```
